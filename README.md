## General Description
This project is a web application developed with Node.js and Express, providing a RESTful API for managing sustainability measures taken by users. Users can record measures related to material management and obtain information about the measures taken.

## Project Structure
The project follows an organized structure as follows:

- **controllers/**: Contains the controllers for each model.
- **db/**: Contains the database configuration and Sequelize models.
- **handlers/**: Contains the handlers for each controller, managing HTTP requests and responses.
- **routers/**: Defines the application routes.
- **.env**: Configuration file for environment variables.
- **app.js**: Main application file.
- **package.json**: npm configuration file.

## API Usage
The API provides the following routes for managing measures and users:


### Users Routes
- `POST /users/create`: Creates a new user.
- `PUT /users/edit`: Edits an existing user.
- `GET /users/:id`: Gets user information by ID.
- `GET /users`: Gets all users.
- `DELETE /users/delete/:id`: Deletes a user by ID.

### Measures Routes
- `POST /measures/create`: Creates a new measure.
- `PUT /measures/edit`: Edits an existing measure.
- `GET /measures/:id`: Gets a measure by its ID.
- `GET /measures/getby`: Gets measures according to different criteria (see details in the implementation).
